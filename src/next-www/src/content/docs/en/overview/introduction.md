title: Project Introduction
description: Basic information about the Proto UI Human-Computer Interaction Protocol project
---

Proto UI is an open-source project aiming to explore **human-computer interaction protocols across platforms, frameworks, and interaction media**.  
We believe that the essence of interaction can be abstracted and reused, without the need for repetitive implementation across different runtimes or frameworks.

## Project Attributes

- **License**: MIT License
- **Nature**: Non-profit open-source exploration
- **Positioning**: Not just another UI framework, but an attempt to define a set of reusable **interaction protocols** to unify the abstraction of prototypes and adapters.

## Team & Timeline

The project was independently initiated by the founder in August 2024.  
The official documentation site will be launched in Septemberâ€“October 2025.  
There are currently two long-term contributors, committed to **maintaining activity until at least 2030**.

## Participation & Feedback

- **Usage**: You can find installation and usage guides in the documentation (under continuous improvement).
- **Contribution**: We welcome contributions in any form, including document revisions, adapter development, and issue feedback. Please refer to the [Contribution Guidelines](./contribution.md).
- **Communication**: Raise questions and share ideas in GitHub Issues or community channels.
