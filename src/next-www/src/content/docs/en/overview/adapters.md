    <p>Translate prototypes into React Components that can be used directly in React applications.</p>
  </Card>

## Scope of Adapters

Unlike prototype libraries, adapters are not tied to a specific design language. Instead, they are responsible for **translating prototypes to the target host environment**.  
In the context of Proto UI:

- A **Host** refers not only to frameworks (such as React and Vue) but also to:
  - Runtime platforms (e.g., Web Components, WeChat Mini Program);
  - Cross-platform technologies (e.g., Flutter, Qt);
  - Even underlying rendering pipelines or I/O systems.
- Therefore, the scope of adapter libraries is **not limited to frameworks** but covers all possible runtime environments.

## Contribution Entry

If you want prototypes to be adapted to a platform you need, but Proto UI has not yet implemented the corresponding adapter, you can try to implement it yourself!
You can refer to the [Contribution Guide](/contributing/adapters), which includes:

- Adapter initialization process
- Implementation conventions for Renderer and h functions
- Detailed definitions and implementation guidelines for internal sub-modules of Adapter

> Proto UI encourages community developers to add new Adapters to expand the scope of protocol-based applications.
